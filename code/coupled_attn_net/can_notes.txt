TODO:
    network topology. specifically, how to parameterize 'edges'. do we want a
    concrete graph? i feel like i want to sample a graphon from one of the
    nodes in the network.. sampling this graphon could give a weighted adjacency structure
    then also how to get the kernels. again, sampling from a 'control' matrix

    think:
        have n nodes. then adjacency structure is an nxn matrix.
        then need to assign kernels to edges.

    x-implement slider based interaction for the ga component
    -implement decoder
        -going to write a sort of deconv stem that happens at the end of can.step

    -rename noise_fbk -> diffusion_noise_scale, and implement this appropriately
